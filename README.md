This assignment, you are given two data files.  The data files are a representation of a face object.




The two files are:




<strong>face-vertices.data</strong>:




every line of this file is  (x, y, z) coordinates of a 3D points

<strong>face-index.txt</strong>:




every line of this file are 3 indices.

each index is an entry in face-vertices.data file referring to one vertex coordinate so the 3 indices indicate 3 vertices of a triangle.




Write a program (python or any other program you prefer), to read this file and display the object in two mode:

<ul>

 <li>points: display all coordinates</li>

 <li>wireframe: display all triangles</li>

</ul>




do not use 3D library, instead, project the 3D coordinates to 2D screen yourself, using the perspective projection equations we talked about in class.
